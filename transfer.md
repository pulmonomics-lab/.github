## How to transfer your individual repository to our organisation repository
You can read official instruction from here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository

Here are my personal example for our group:
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. For example, **ERJ-SNF** under username of *chuanxingli![[Screenshot 2022-11-21 at 15.25.15.png]]*

2. Under your repository name, click  **Settings**.

3. Under "Danger Zone" (At the bottom of **Settings**), click **Transfer**.

4. Read the information about transferring a repository, then type the name of the user or organization you'd like to transfer ownership of the repository to. For our group, username is **pulmonomics-lab**.

5. Type the name of the repository you'd like to transfer, then click **I understand, transfer this repository**.

*After transferred, you can still use your previous git APP to update the repository as what you have done before.*
