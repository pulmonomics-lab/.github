# Research description of Åsa Wheelock's lab at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden
Our research program can be broadly defined as developing a respiratory systems biology approach utilizing a range of ‘omics, bioinformatics, & statistical platforms to characterize molecular sub-phenotypes of chronic inflammatory lung diseases. We focus equal efforts on translational studies of the response to environmental exposures in patients with COPD and asthma, and innovation & methodology development in the fields of intact quantitative proteomics, multivariate modeling and data integration. Our translational systems medicine studies encompass profiling of mRNA, miRNA, proteomes, metabolomes and lipid mediators of from multiple lung compartments (airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, exosomes, and bronchoalveolar exudates) using multiple omics platforms, in combination with extensive clinical phenotyping. The strength of our approaches is the ability to integrate information from multiple molecular levels, including the mRNA, miRNA, protein and metabolite levels, with rigorous clinical characterizations in order to understand disease mechanisms on a systems level.
